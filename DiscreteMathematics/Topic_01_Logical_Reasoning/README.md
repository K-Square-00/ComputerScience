Prove for any integer n if n  > 11 then n can be represented as sum of two composite numbers.

<details>
  <summary>Solution/Hint:</summary>

Prove by contradiction: <br />
Suppose exists an integer n > 11 but cannot be represented as sum of two composite numbers. <br />
Let $n = (n-4) +4 = (n-6)+6 = (n-8)+8$ then $(n-4),(n-6),(n-8)$ must be primes. <br />
Hence, $(n-5)$ must be divisible by 3. <br /> 
Let $(n-5)=3k$ then $(n-8) = 3(k-1)$ which is contracted with $(n-6)$ is prime.  <br />
Done.
